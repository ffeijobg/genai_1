Hugging Face is a leading open-source platform for natural language processing that provides a wide range of pretrained models and tools for fine-tuning and deploying these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to load pre-trained models from Hugging Face and make inferences using the Pipeline module. Additionally, you will learn how to further train pre-trained LLMs on your own data (self-supervised fine-tuning). By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to pretrain LLMs and store them to later fine-tune for your specific use cases. This will empower you to create powerful and customized natural language processing solutions.\n"

The objective is to enable the model to learn contextual understanding and fill in missing information.\n",

For language modeling, particularly for models like BERT that use masked language modeling (MLM), this collator prepares training batches by automatically masking tokens according to a specified probability. Here are the details of the parameters used:\n",

    "- **mlm_probability=0.15**: Sets the probability with which tokens will be masked. A probability of 0.15 means that, on average, 15% of the tokens in any sequence will be replaced with a mask token.\n"
